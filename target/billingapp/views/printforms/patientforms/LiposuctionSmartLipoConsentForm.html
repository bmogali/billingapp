                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">INSTRUCTIONS</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>This is an informed-consent document that has been prepared to help inform you concerning suction-assisted lipectomy and ultrasound-assisted lipectomy (“liposuction”) surgery, its risks, and alternative treatment.  It is important that you read this information carefully and completely.  Please initial each page, indicating that you have read the page and sign the consent for surgery as proposed by your doctor.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>
                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">INSTRUCTIONS</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>Liposuction is a surgical technique to remove unwanted deposits of fat from specific areas of the body, including the face and neck, upper arms, trunk, abdomen, buttocks, hips and thighs, and the knees, calves, and ankles.  This is not a substitute for weight reduction, but a method for removing localized deposits of fatty tissue that do not respond to diet or exercise.  Liposuction may be performed as a primary procedure for body contouring or may be combined with other surgical techniques such as a facelift, abdominoplasty, or thigh lift procedures to tighten loose skin and supporting structures.  The best candidates for liposuction are individuals of relatively normal weight who have excess fat in particular body areas.  Having firm, elastic skin will result in a better final contour after liposuction.  Hanging skin will not reshape itself to the new contours and may require additional surgical techniques to remove and tighten excess skin.  Body-contour irregularities due to structures other than fat cannot be improved by this technique.  Liposuction itself will not improve areas of dimpled skin known as 'cellulite'.  <strong>Suction-assisted lipectomy</strong> surgery is performed by using a hollow metal surgical instrument known as a cannula that is inserted through small skin incision(s) and is passed back and forth through the area of fatty deposit.  The cannula is attached to a vacuum source, which provides the suction needed to remove the fatty tissue.  In some situations, a special cannula may be used that emits ultrasonic energy to break down fatty deposits.  This technique is known as <strong>Laser-assisted lipectomy</strong>.  Depending on your needs, your surgeon may recommend suction-assisted lipectomy alone, or in combination with ultrasound-assisted lipectomy.  There are a variety of different techniques used by plastic surgeons for liposuction and care following surgery.  Liposuction may be performed under local or general anesthesia.  <strong>Tumescent liposuction technique</strong> involves the infiltration of fluid containing dilute local anesthetic and epinephrine into areas of fatty deposits.  This technique can reduce discomfort at the time of surgery, as well as reduce post-operative bruising.  Support garments and dressings are worn to control swelling and promote healing.  Your surgeon may recommend that you make arrangements to donate a unit of your own blood that would be used if a blood transfusion were necessary after surgery. </p><div class="margin-V10"></div>

                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">ALTERNATE TREATMENT</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>Alternative forms of management consist of not treating the areas of fatty deposits.  Diet and exercise regimens may be of benefit in the overall reduction of excess body fat.  Direct removal of excess skin and fatty tissue may be necessary in addition to liposuction in some patients.  Risks and potential complications are associated with alternative forms of treatment that involve surgery.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>

                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">RISKS OF LIPOSUCTION SURGERY</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>Every surgical procedure involves a certain amount of risk, and it is important that you understand the risks involved with liposuction.  An individual’s choice to undergo a surgical procedure is based on the comparison of the risk to potential benefit.  Although the majority  of patients do not experience these complications, you should discuss each of them with your plastic surgeon to make sure you understand the risks, potential complications, and consequences of liposuction.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>
                <section class="spacer-margin-left">
                    <p><strong>Patient selection</strong> - Individuals with poor skin tone, medical problems, obesity, or unrealistic expectations may not be candidates for liposuction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bleeding</strong> – It is possible, though unusual, to have a bleeding episode during or after surgery.  Should post-operative bleeding occur, it may require emergency treatment to drain accumulated blood or require a blood transfusion.  Do not take aspirin or anti-inflammatory medications for seven days before surgery, as this may increase the risk of bleeding.</p>
                    <p><strong>Infection</strong> – An infection is quite unusual after this type of surgery.  Should an infection occur, treatment including antibiotics or additional surgery may be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Change in skin sensation</strong> - A temporary decrease in skin sensation after liposuction may occur.  This usually resolves over a period of time.  Diminished (or complete loss of skin sensation) infrequently occurs and may not totally resolve.</p>
                    <p><strong>Skin discoloration/swelling</strong> – Skin discoloration and swelling normally occurs following liposuction.  In rare situations, swelling and skin discoloration may persist for long periods of time.  Permanent skin discoloration is rare.</p>
                    <p><strong>Skin contour irregularities</strong> – Contour irregularities and depressions in the skin may occur after liposuction. Visible and palpable wrinkling of skin can occur.  Additional treatments including surgery may be necessary to treat skin contour irregularities following liposuction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Asymmetry</strong> – It may not be possible to achieve symmetrical body appearance from liposuction surgery.  Factors such as skin tone, bony prominence, and muscle tone may contribute to normal asymmetry in body features.</p>
                    <p><strong>Seroma</strong> – Fluid accumulations infrequently occur in areas where liposuction has been performed.  Additional treatments or surgery to drain accumulations of fluid may be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Long term effects</strong> – Subsequent alterations in body contour may occur as the result of aging, weight loss or gain, pregnancy, or other circumstances not related to liposuction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tumescent liposuction</strong> – There is the possibility that large volumes of fluid containing dilute local anesthetic drugs and epinephrine that is injected into fatty deposits during surgery may contribute to fluid overload or systemic reaction to these medications.  Additional treatment including hospitalization may be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other</strong> – You may be disappointed with the results of surgery.  Infrequently, it is necessary to perform additional surgery to improve your results.</p>
                    <p><strong>Surgical anesthesia</strong> – Both local and general anesthesia involve risk.  There is the possibility of complication, injury, and even death from all forms of surgical  anesthesia or sedation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Allergic reaction</strong> – In rare cases, local allergies to tape, suture material, or topical preparations have been reported.  Systemic reactions which are more serious may occur due to drugs used during surgery and prescription medicines.  Allergic reactions may require additional treatment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Surgical shock</strong> – In rare circumstances, liposuction can cause severe trauma, particularly when multiple or extensive areas are suctioned at one time. Although serious complications are infrequent, infections or excessive fluid loss can lead to severe illness and even death.  Should surgical shock occur after liposuction, hospitalization and additional treatment would be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pulmonary complications</strong> – Fat embolism syndrome occurs when fat droplets are trapped in the lungs.  This is a very rare and possibly fatal complication of suction-assisted lipectomy.  Should fat embolism or other pulmonary complications occur, additional treatment including hospitalization may be necessary. </p>
                    <p><strong>Skin loss</strong> – Skin loss is very rare after liposuction.  Additional treatments including surgery may be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Chronic pain</strong> – Chronic pain and discomfort following liposuction is very rare. </p>
                    <p><strong>Laser-Assisted Lipectomy</strong> – Risks associated with the use of this technique include the above mentioned risks and the following specific risks:</p>
                    <p><strong>Burns</strong> – Ultrasonic energy may produce burns and tissue damage either at the location where the cannula is inserted into the skin or in other areas if the cannula touches the undersurface of the skin for prolonged periods of time.  If burns occur, additional treatment and surgery may be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cannula Fragmentation</strong> - Ultrasonic energy produced within the cannula may cause disintegration (fragmentation) of the surgical instrument.  The occurrence and effect of this is unpredictable.  Should this occur, additional treatment, including surgery, may be necessary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Unknown risks</strong> – The long term effect on tissue and organs to exposure to short-duration, high-intensity ultrasonic energy is unknown.  There is the possibility that additional risk factors of ultrasound-assisted lipectomy may be discovered.</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">ALTERNATE TREATMENT</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>There are many variable conditions in addition to risk and potential surgical complications that may influence the long term result from liposuction.  Even though risks and complications occur infrequently, the risks cited are particularly associated with liposuction.  Other complications and risks can occur but are even more uncommon.  Should complications occur, additional surgery or other treatments may be necessary.  The practice of medicine and surgery is not an exact science.  Although good results are expected, there is no guarantee or warranty expressed or implied, on the results that may be obtained.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>

                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>The cost of surgery involves several charges for the services provided.  The total includes fees charges by your doctor, the cost of surgical supplies, anesthesia, laboratory tests, and possible outpatient hospital charges, depending on where the surgery is performed.  Depending on whether the cost of surgery is covered by an insurance plan, you will be responsible for necessary co-payments, deductibles, and charges not covered.  Additional costs may occur should complications develop from surgery.  Secondary surgery or hospital day-surgery charges involved with reversionary surgery would also be your responsibility.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>
                <div class="margin-V10"></div>
                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">DISCLAIMER</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>Informed-consent documents are used to communicate information about the proposed surgical treatment of a disease or condition along with disclosure of risks and alternative forms of treatment(s).The informed-consent process attempts to define principles of risk disclosure that should generally meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances.</p><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>However, informed consent documents should not be considered all inclusive in defining other methods of care and risks encountered.  Your plastic surgeon may provide you with additional or different information which is based on all the facts in your particular case and the state of medical knowledge.</p><div class="margin-V5"></div>
