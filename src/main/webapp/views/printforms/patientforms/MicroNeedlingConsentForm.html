                <div class="margin-V20"></div>
                <p>The concept of Micro Needling is based on the skin’s natural ability to repair itself whenever it encounters physical damage such as cuts, burns and other abrasions. Immediately after an injury to the skin our body reuses the damaged collagen and elastin fibres as well as other damaged skin components to produce new ones. Skin Needling allows for controlled induction of the skin’s self repair mechanism by creating micro-“injuries” in the skin which triggers new collagen synthesis. The result is smoother, firmer and younger looking skin. Micro needling is process carried out with a roller that is covered with numerous tiny needles. These needles penetrate the upper layers of skin to a depth of up to 0.5 mm (depending on the needle length used). This process has two major benefits. It effectively stimulates collagen formation at the same time as providing a clear channel for topical serums to be absorbed more effectively through the top layer (epidermis) of skin. Dermarolling creates a very minor (almost microscopic) trauma which lasts for a short period of time and does not result in bruising or swelling in the treated area. Skin Needling or Micro-Needling is a form of Collagen Induction Therapy which is intended to smooth wrinkles, and improve depressed acne scarring.</p>
                <p>As your aesthetician rolls the Dermaroller across your skin, it makes pin point punctures into the dermis – most of which are simply temporarily opening your pores. Your body perceives this as damage, which triggers the release of growth factors that, in turn, stimulate the production of elastin and collagen. The human body is designed to react to any injury by initiating the healing process, but usually it will just mend as far as it has to keep you in good health – which is very different to healing to a cosmetic level. By persistently triggering this healing process, you encourage your body to keep repairing until the job is done. Dermarolling may be conducted safely on all colours of skin and all types of skin. The epidermis and melanocytes in the basal area are not damaged, so there’s no possibility of post inflammatory hyper pigmentation.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>
