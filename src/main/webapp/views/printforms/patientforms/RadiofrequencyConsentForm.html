                <div class="margin-V20"></div>
                <p>Radio Frequency is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure to help smooth, tighten, contour skin and temporarily reduce the appearance of cellulite. It can help treat sagging skin, lack of definition in the jaw line, loose jowls, sagging neck skin, wrinkles and fine lines.</p>
                <p>Radio Frequency uses electrical pulses to target and penetrate the under layer of skin using heat to stimulate collagen. The outer layer of skin is cooled during the process to avoid damage. During procedure you will feel a brief deep heating sensation.</p>
                <p>Results should be visible immediately and improve over a period of two to six months.</p>
                <p>Treatment Sites include; Face, Area Surrounding Lip, Outer orbit area of the Eyes, Arms, Thighs, Tummy, Hands and Buttocks.</p>
                <p>As with any medical procedure, you should be aware of the safety issues and restrictions associated with radiofrequency therapy.</p>
                <p>I understand the results may vary from person-to-person and that at least 2- 4 treatments are necessary to observe results. The results of Radiofrequency are usually dramatic, although the practice of medicine is not an exact science and no guarantees can be or have been made concerning expected results. No refunds will be given for treatments received</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>

                        <li>I also understand that the good dietary habits, sufficient intake of liquids and light physical activity after the treatment are beneficial for optimum results.</li>

                        <li>Although rare adverse effects such as allergic reaction or nausea may occur.</li>
                        <li>I understand that increased intake of liquids is recommended for 24 hours before and after treatments and that mild exercise (walking, jogging, etc.) is beneficial after treatment. Otherwise, I understand that results of the therapy may be affected.</li>
