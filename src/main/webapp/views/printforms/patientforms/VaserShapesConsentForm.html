                <div class="margin-V20"></div>
                <h3 class="font-bold-6">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The VASER Shape System delivers a non-invasive treatment that uses therapeutic massage and the combined action of two low-frequency ultrasound heads cross-sectioned onto the area being treated. This advanced ultrasound hand piece is placed over the skin so that the deep penetrating action of the ultrasound is concentrated onto the affected tissue only, offering a treatment that is both effective and safe.  The action of the low-frequency ultrasound should always be followed with a lymphatic drainage massage, which helps eliminate excess liquids produced by the treatment. Lymphatic drainage is performed through use of a handpiece with an elastomeric membrane, which applies movement to the tissue.  This membrane operates in an undulating motion which gently lifts, folds and compresses the tissue following a sequence of movements specific to each area being treated.  This manipulation of the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues improves lymphatic, arterial and venous circulation.  With the same hand piece, the lymph nodes are opened prior to drainage, thus allowing the elimination of toxins and lipids in the interstitial spaces caused by the action of the ultrasound.</p>
                <div class="margin-V10"></div>
                <h3 class="font-bold-6">ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT</h3>
                <p>Alternative forms of management of the condition or conditions being treated may include diet and exercise regimes which may be of benefit in the overall appearance of cellulite, and both over-the-counter and prescription drugs, as well as mild heat therapy and certain types of physical therapy or massage, which may provide temporary relief of minor muscle aches and pains, muscle spasms, and joint contractures, and temporarily improve local blood circulation.  Certain types of these conditions may be relieved or improved through surgery, which carries with it risks and potential complications.  An alternative you should consider is to have no treatment at all. </p>
