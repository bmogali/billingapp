                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">I DECLARE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>The goal of laser skin surgery is to reduce or partially eliminate facial wrinkles, veins, unwanted hair, or reduce scarring from skin conditions such as acne.  Generally, the results of laser skin procedures demonstrate improvement in the problem of the skin; however, a complete elimination of wrinkles, vessels, unwanted hair, or scarring is not a realistic expectation.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>
                <h3 class="font-bold-6 fontL">Alternatives to Laser Skin Procedures:</h3><div class="margin-V5"></div>
                <p>The alternative to laser skin procedures include Microdermabrasion, chemabrasion, injection, sclerotherapy, and electrolysis.  The advantages and disadvantages (risks and benefits) of each of these alternatives to laser skin surgery have been explained to me as well as the alternative of having no surgery, accepting my present skin condition, using cosmetics and considering alternative methods.</p><div class="margin-V10"></div>

                    <ol class="list-space-num">
                        <li><strong>Blindness/Cornel Burns</strong> – There is a risk of accidental eye injury by the laser energy or beam, which could cause blindness or burns of the eyeball.  This is unlikely since complete eye protection is provided at all times during the laser energy applications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flash-Fires</strong> – Utilization of laser energy always raises the possibility of fire-related incidents.  These are rare and are preventable by careful maintenance of the surgical equipment and stringent laser safety precautions.</li>

                    <ol class="list-space-num">
                        <li><strong>Pain</strong> – Discomfort, burning sensation or pain the first few days after surgery.  A local anesthetic may be used to block pain during the treatment, but some degree of discomfort will occur after the anesthetic effects have worn off and this pain may persist for several days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Redness of Skin</strong> – Erythema or redness of the skin for a two – to six month period of possibly longer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Swelling</strong> – Temporary edema (swelling) or ecchymosis (bruising) of the tissue of the face and neck, usually subsiding in three to seven days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wound Healing</strong> – Oozing, weeping, crusting or flakiness of the treated area, usually persisting for one to four weeks.</li>

                        <li><strong>Skin Thickening</strong> – Textural changes of the treated skin, such as skin thickening, which may persist for a variable time following the laser skin resurfacing treatment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cysts</strong> – Milia or cysts, especially in the eyelid skin region (if the eyelid skin is included in the area of treatment by the laser energy), particularly of ointments were used in the postoperative phase for a protracted period. </li>
                        <li><strong>Skin Tightness</strong> - Sensation of skin tightness (peaks at 3-8 weeks postoperatively).</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact Dermatitis</strong> – Contact dermatitis due secondarily to topical preparations (ointments) used post – operatively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Herpes simplex dermatitis (fever Blisters)</strong> – Occurrence or recurrence of herpes simples dermatitis, particularly if not pre- intra- and post operatively treated with a systemic antiviral medication such as Zovirax.  I will tell my physician if I have had Herpes simplex virus infection to start Valtrex for 10 days prior to laser skin surgery.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skin Itchiness</strong> – Pruritis or itching in the early healing phase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skin Hyperpigmentation</strong> – Transient hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin), especially in darker-skinned people, occurring three to eight weeks after laser therapy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cellulitis or Skin Infections</strong> – Cellulitis or infection of the skin and soft tissues, especially if careful post-operative hygiene is not practiced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skin Hyopigmentation</strong> – Hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin), which occurs because of laser-induced injury to the melanocytes (pigment containing cells in the skin) and which can be permanent.</li>

                    <ol class="list-space-num">
                        <li><strong>Increased susceptibility to sun</strong> – There is probably a lifelong risk of greater susceptibility of laser skin treated areas to the photo-aging effects of sunlight and the carcinogenic (cancer producing effects of ultraviolet wavelengths inherent in sun exposure or the use of tanning devices.  For these reasons, avoidance of sun exposure or protection against ultraviolet light damage to your skin by the use of sun-screening or sun blocking lotions with SPF (sun protective factor) of 30 or higher is strongly advised.  I have been offered the medical sun blocking agent SPF 30 to use after the procedure.</li>
                        <li><strong>The risk of scarring exists in all cases</strong> - It is variable and is often related to an individual’s genetic makeup.  Scarring can be reduced by carefully following appropriate aftercare instructions and notifying the physician if a problem develops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Skin Pigment Changes</strong> – Skin color and texture changes may occur.  At the junction of the treated and untreated areas, there may be a difference in color, texture and/or thickness of the skin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Infection</strong> – Infection is a risk that occurs in any invasive or surgical procedure.  It is minimized by proper surgical technique and proper post-operative care.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ectropion</strong> – Cicatricial (scarring or shrinkage) ectropion (out-turning of the eyelid) and/or punctal (tear hole) evasion can occur, despite optimal surgical technique.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blepharoptosis</strong> – Blepharoptosis (drooping of the eyelid) can result from inadvertent injury to structures n the upper eyelid, especially in thin-skinned people.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <p>I understand that exposure to the sun and excess heat must be avoided at all costs for a period of 6 months.  No unprotected sun bathing is permitted for 6 months.  To do so would encourage skin pigment changes and rhytids (wrinkles) necessitating further treatment. I understand this is an elective procedure and that laser skin surgery is not reversible. I also understand that more than one laser skin surgery procedure may be required to achieve the optimal obtain – able results.</p>
                <p>I understand the practice of medicine, surgery is not an exact science, and I acknowledge that no guarantees have been made to me concerning the results and procedure.  It is not possible to state every complication that may occur as a result of laser skin surgery. Complications or a poor outcome may manifest weeks, months, or even years after laser skin resurfacing surgery. My surgeon has explained laser skin surgery and its risks, benefits and alternatives and has answered all my questions about the laser skin surgical procedure.  I therefore consent to having laser skin surgery.</p>

I give my informed consent for laser treatment today as well as for future treatments, as needed I am aware that the practice of medicine and surgery is not an exact science and I acknowledge that no guarantees have been made to me as to the results of the procedure nor are there any guarantees against an unfavorable result.
